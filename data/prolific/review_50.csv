2,1,"So Disapointing, I'm Gutted","I was overjoyed to find a figurine that matched my baby's nursery theme, but oh man, what a let down. When it arrived, the box had a tear on the side, and I noticed a small chip on the figurine's foot right away. The paint job looks sloppy around the basket, as if some portion was rushed or got smudgged in transit. I also can't believ how small it is for the price, feels like a cheap knockoff rather than a high-end piece of art. The listing said 'handmade in Spain' but I'm starting to wonder if they even checked for quality before shipping it out. Tried contacting the manufacturer, but they gave me a run-around about contacting the seller, which just wasted more time. My cousin used to collect LLADRÓ, and hers look impeccable, so I'm perplexed how I ended up with something so subpar. It's quite frustrating because this was supposed to be a keepsake for my child, yet it doesn't even stand upright without wobbling. The color on the basket is also slightly discolorered, kind of a dull grey, not like the crisp white I expected. I see tiny rough edges around the hair, like the mold wasn't properly finished or something was missed. If I'd known I'd get such a flawed piece, I'd have looked for a secondhand one that was at least well-cared for. Part of me wonders if I just got a defective unit, but the reponse from customer service hasn't been helpful. I tried to fix the wobble by adjusting the base with a small felt pad, but that shouldn't be necessary for a brand-new figurine. My older sister was so disappointed when she saw it, she told me to return it immediatly. Honestly, I'd rather buy a different brand next time because this fiasco has cost me time, money, and loads of frustration.",B0006V2XBW,0,Fake

10,3,Not Bad for the Price,"I used these frames for my diploma display in the hallway. They look fairly decent, though one corner came scuffed. The wood feels slightly flimsy but is still holding up. Also the mat was a bit off-white. I'd say they're okay if you're on a budget.",B09B6MCGY2,3,Fake

17,5,Juicing is Now a Breeze,"I used to buy bottled juices all the time, but they never tasted as vibrant as fresh ones from home. This Brevill juicer extracts so quickly that my morning routine is now a cinch. I love how it can handle carrots, apples, and ginger without jamming or losing power. Sometimes I forget to cut the fruit smaller, and it still takes it like a champ, though it can get a tiny bit loud. The cleanup isn't too bad, especially if you rinse it right after use, but the mesh filter needs a quick brush. I had a cheap juicer years ago that left huge pieces of pulp, but this one gets almost all the liquid out! One small gripe is that the pitcher lid can pop off if you pour too fast, but that's easily avoided with a gentle tilt. The stainless steel finish looks professional on my counter, and it's easy to wipe down if it splatters. Sometimes, my family complains about the noise early in the morning, but the results are worth the slight ruckus. Every time I whip up a big batch of green juice, I feel like I'm fueling my body with pure energy. Even my sister borrowed it for her juice cleanse and was thoroughly amazed at how efficient it was, so I might have to fend her off from taking it permanently. In the end, I'd buy this again in a heartbeat because it's truly turned me into a daily juicer, and I can't imagine going back to store-bought.",B003R28HWQ,0,Fake
18,5,Ease of use,I have Never use silicone cooking devices before. However this has changed my mind the bread that I made came out easy and intact.

35,5,Versatile And Powerful,"I never realized how much I needed a 3-in-1 stand mixer until I tried this COSTWAY model. It's absolutely changed my cooking routine, from kneading dough for homemade sourdough bread to grinding fresh meat for burgers. I used to dread making large batches of dough, but now it's a breeze with the strong 800W motor that doesn't strain or overheat. The included juice blender is a total bonus, letting me whip up morning smoothies without cluttering my countertop with an extra appliance. My only quible is that it came with instructions that were a bit unclear, but I figured everything out after a quick look at a tutorial. After about two weeks, I tried the sausage stuffer attachment for a big family cookout—holy smokes, it worked perfectly. The mixing bowl is huge, so I can fit enough batter for two cakes at once, which realy saves me time. I accidentally left the mixer running while I grabbed more flour, but it handled the dough just fine without wobbling or walking across the counter. I also appreciate that cleanup is quick—just rinse and wipe, and everything stays in good shape. Though it's not as quiet as smaller mixers, the noise level is definitely manageable. Even my kids's enjoy helping me cook now, since it's so easy to set up the attachments. Some folks might find it a bit heavy, but I prefer the sturdy build over a flimsy one. I was worried it might overheat after a few minutes of heavy use, but so far, it's held up like a champ. The black finish is sleek, and it doesn't scratch easily either. Overall, I'd highly recommended this to anyone who wants a multi-function, durable mixer that truly delivers.",B089GGCSMM,4,Fake
