2,1,"So Disapointing, I'm Gutted","I was overjoyed to find a figurine that matched my baby's nursery theme, but oh man, what a let down. When it arrived, the box had a tear on the side, and I noticed a small chip on the figurine's foot right away. The paint job looks sloppy around the basket, as if some portion was rushed or got smudgged in transit. I also can't believ how small it is for the price, feels like a cheap knockoff rather than a high-end piece of art. The listing said 'handmade in Spain' but I'm starting to wonder if they even checked for quality before shipping it out. Tried contacting the manufacturer, but they gave me a run-around about contacting the seller, which just wasted more time. My cousin used to collect LLADRÓ, and hers look impeccable, so I'm perplexed how I ended up with something so subpar. It's quite frustrating because this was supposed to be a keepsake for my child, yet it doesn't even stand upright without wobbling. The color on the basket is also slightly discolorered, kind of a dull grey, not like the crisp white I expected. I see tiny rough edges around the hair, like the mold wasn't properly finished or something was missed. If I'd known I'd get such a flawed piece, I'd have looked for a secondhand one that was at least well-cared for. Part of me wonders if I just got a defective unit, but the reponse from customer service hasn't been helpful. I tried to fix the wobble by adjusting the base with a small felt pad, but that shouldn't be necessary for a brand-new figurine. My older sister was so disappointed when she saw it, she told me to return it immediatly. Honestly, I'd rather buy a different brand next time because this fiasco has cost me time, money, and loads of frustration.",B0006V2XBW,0,Fake
