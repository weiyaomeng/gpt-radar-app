            <h2>Information for Research Participants</h2>
            <p>Your participation in this research is through Prolific, and you may change your mind about being involved in the research at any time, and without giving a reason. However, you will receive the Prolific reward only if you complete the study.</p>
            <p>This information sheet is designed to give you full details of the research project, its goals, the research team, the research funder, and what you will be asked to do as part of the research.  If you have any questions that are not answered by this information sheet, please ask. This research has been reviewed and given favourable opinion by the Nottingham University Business School Research Ethics Committee.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the research project called?</h3>
            <p>Research Project: Human and AI-Generated Review Classification</p>

            <h3>Who is carrying out the research?</h3>
            <p>The research is being carried out by a team of academic staff and researchers from the Business School, University of Nottingham. The research is not externally funded and is supported through internal resources from the N/Lab of the Business School. No other institutions are involved in this project.</p>

            <h3>What is the research about?</h3>
            <p>This research is about understanding how well people can tell the difference between reviews written by humans and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Participants will read 50 short product reviews and decide whether they think each one is real (written by a human) or fake (generated by AI). We also want to understand how confident participants feel about their decisions. This study will help us learn more about how people perceive AI-generated content and how confident they are in making these judgments.</p>

            <h3>What groups of people have been asked to take part, and why?</h3>
            <p>We are using the Prolific platform to recruit anonymous participants for this study. Prolific will automatically select participants who meet the general criteria. This approach allows us to include individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, helping us gain a broad understanding of how people distinguish between AI-generated and human-written content. Your participation will contribute valuable insights to this research.</p>

            <h3>What will research participants be asked to do?</h3>
            <p>Participants will be asked to complete an online survey where they will read 50 short product reviews and indicate each as either "Real" (human-written) or "Fake" (AI-generated). They will also indicate their confidence level for each decision. The survey is expected to take approximately 10 minutes to complete. </p>
            <p>There are minimal risks involved, as the task does not involve sensitive or distressing topics. Participants will receive £5 compensation for their time, provided through the Prolific platform. No additional prizes or expenses are offered, and responses will not be recorded beyond the survey itself.</p>

            <h3>What will happen to the information I provide?</h3>
            <p>The information you provide will be kept completely anonymous and securely stored. We will not collect any personally identifiable information. All data stored will be password protected. </p>
            <p>Your responses will be analysed in aggregate form, meaning individual answers will not be identifiable. Findings will be reported as overall trends and patterns, ensuring your anonymity is fully protected. The data will be used solely for this study and any related academic publications or presentations.</p>
            
            <h3>What will be the outputs of the research?</h3>
            <p>The outputs of this research are intended to include peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. The results may also be used for academic knowledge exchange activities, such as workshops or seminars.</p>
            <p>Participants can request a summary of the research findings if they are interested, which will be made available once the study is complete.</p>
