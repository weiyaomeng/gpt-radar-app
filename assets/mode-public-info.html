            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"> <strong> ü§î Can you spot the difference between human-written and AI-generated reviews?</strong></p>
        
            <h3>üîç How It Works:</h3>
            <p>You will be shown a series of product reviews. Your task is to decide whether each review was <strong>written by a human</strong> or <strong>generated by AI</strong>. After each decision, you will rate your confidence in your choice.</p>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>üí° Why This Test?</h3>
            <p>This is a fun way to challenge your ability to detect AI-generated text! Additionally, we may analyse responses to better understand how people distinguish real vs. AI-generated content.</p>
